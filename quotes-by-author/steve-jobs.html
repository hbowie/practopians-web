					<p>tags: <a href='../tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a>, <a href='../tags/equality.html' rel='tag'>equality</a></p>
					<blockquote>
						Jobs: What I do all day is meet with teams of people and work on ideas and solve problems to make new products, to make new marketing programs, whatever it is. Mossberg: And are people willing to tell you you're wrong? Jobs: (laughs) Yeah. Mossberg: I mean, other than snarky journalists, I mean people that work forâ€¦ Jobs: Oh, yeah, no we have wonderful arguments. Mossberg: And do you win them all? Jobs: Oh no I wish I did. No, you see you can't. If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you, you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to, you have to be run by ideas, not hierarchy. The best ideas have to win, otherwise good people don't stay. Mossberg: But you must be more than a facilitator who runs meetings. You obviously contribute your own ideas. Jobs: I contribute ideas, sure. Why would I be there if I didn't?

					<p>tags: <a href='../tags/tools.html' rel='tag'>tools</a></p>
					<blockquote>
						I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. Humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud of a showing for the Crown of Creation. That didn't look so good, but then someone at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle and a human on a bicycle blew the condor away. That's what a computer is to me: the computer is the most remarkable tool that we've ever come up with. It's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.

					<p>tags: <a href='../tags/individuals.html' rel='tag'>individuals</a>, <a href='../tags/progress.html' rel='tag'>progress</a></p>
					<blockquote>
						When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.

		  			<h3>The Underlying Principle of the Problem</h3>
					<p>tags: <a href='../tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a></p>
					<blockquote>
						When you start looking at a problem and it seems really simple, you don't really understand the complexity of the problem. Then you get into the problem, and you see that it's really complicated, and you come up with all these convoluted solutions. That's sort of the middle, and that's where most people stop.... But the really great person will keep on going and find the key, the underlying principle of the problem -- and come up with an elegant, really beautiful solution that works. That's what we wanted to do with Mac.

					<p>tags: <a href='../tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a>, <a href='../tags/progress.html' rel='tag'>progress</a></p>
					<blockquote>
						There's an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love. 'I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.' And we've always tried to do that at Apple. Since the very very beginning. And we always will.

						The axis today is not liberal and conservative, the axis is constructive-destructive, and you've cast your lot with the destructive people. Fox has become an incredibly destructive force in our society. You can be better, and this is going to be your legacy if you're not careful.

		  			<h3>Technology married with the humanities</h3>
					<p>tags: <a href='../tags/integral.html' rel='tag'>integral</a></p>
					<blockquote>
						Technology alone is not enough. It's technology married with the liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields the results that makes our hearts sing. Nowhere is that more true than in these post-PC devicesâ€¦ that need to be even easier to use than a PC, that need to be even more intuitive than a PC; and where the software and the hardware and the applications need to intertwine in an even more seamless way than they do on a PC. We think we are on the right track with this. We think we have the right architecture not just in silicon but in the organization to build these kinds of products.

		  			<h3>Good Management is Like The Beatles</h3>
					<p>tags: <a href='../tags/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a>, <a href='../tags/equality.html' rel='tag'>equality</a></p>
					<blockquote>
						My model of management is the Beatles. The reason I say that is because each of the key people in the Beatles kept the others from going off in the directions of their bad tendencies. They sort of kept each other in check. And then when they split up, they never did anything as good. It was the chemistry of a small group of people, and that chemistry was greater than the sum of the parts.
