          <h2>The Big Picture</h2>


					<p>By Herb Bowie</p>
					<p>tags: <a href='../../tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>, <a href='../../tags/systemic.html' rel='tag'>systemic</a></p>


<p>When reading the news on most days I find myself thinking that there is something larger and deeper going on than the items being reported. It seems to me that there are forces at work behind the events of the day, forces that are slowly and inexorably guiding the hands of the players who happen to be on the stage at any given moment. The various factors at work pop up in my head and in my conversations from time to time, but I&rsquo;ve finally decided it&rsquo;s time to get these ideas out of my head and into written form. </p>
<p>Knowledge of the Practopian <a href="http://www.practopians.org/core/principles.html">Principles</a> and <a href="http://www.practopians.org/core/values.html">Values</a> is probably a useful, but not a necessary, prerequisite for an understanding of these thoughts. </p>
<p>Each paragraph below makes a single, specific, important point, and later paragraphs build on earlier ones, so I&rsquo;ve numbered everything to keep it all straight. </p>
<p>Without any further preamble, then, here are the ideas that, taken together, seem to me to form a big picture of the most significant forces at play in our modern world. </p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p>Following the laws of evolution, all life forms on earth compete with one another in order to maximize the sizes of their respective populations.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>The human species, <em>homo sapiens</em>, has become the dominant life form on our planet, the big winner in the evolutionary competition.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Our main competitive advantage in this evolutionary struggle is our unique use of culture to augment our physical capabilities, and our switch from biological to cultural evolution as our primary means of rapidly increasing the capabilities of our species. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Culture includes: the development of language, in spoken and written forms; the acquisition of scientific knowledge and technology; and the development of new ways to organize human beings and their activities. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>As our competitive advantage over other species has increased, human population levels have increased accordingly: 1 billion people in 1800, 3 billion by 1960, 6 billion by 2000, and a projection of 9 billion by the year 2040. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Cultural evolution has permitted us high reproduction rates and lengthy life spans, and has helped to accommodate ever increasing numbers of humans on the planet, through developments such as farming, industrialization and urbanization. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Culture, including the application of science and technology, can be thought of as an amplifier for human productivity. Through the use of culture, the typical human can produce greater amounts of goods and services of use to other humans.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>As human population levels rise, they lock us into the forms of technology and organization that are necessary to sustain those numbers of people. So it does us no good to cultivate romantic notions of going back to simpler and earlier ways of life, if those ways of life are incapable of sustaining the population levels we have now attained. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Although a more productive culture <em>can</em> produce a better quality of life for the majority of its members, there is no guarantee that this will happen, and a knowledge of history tells us that many such &ldquo;advances&rdquo; have resulted in a worsening quality of life for many members of society. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>When productivity is increasing, there are greater amounts of goods and services per capita, and it is easy for the more powerful members of our society to share with the weaker members. As we say, a rising tide lifts all boats. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>When productivity is stagnant or falling, goods and services become more scarce, and the more powerful members of society tend to accumulate and hoard the available wealth, rather than share it freely. A falling tide, as we might say, strands some of the boats. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>If we take a very broad and fuzzy view of what&rsquo;s going on over time, it might seem that advances in science and technology &ndash; and the corresponding increases in productivity that they enable &ndash; happen more or less continuously, and can be trusted to continue at the same rate on into our future. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>If we take a slightly closer look, though, we can see more clearly that technological advances tend to come in waves: the discovery of the wheel, and everything that it enabled; the discovery of iron, and the ways that it can be shaped and used; the discovery of coal, and other subterranean sources of energy; the development of engines that can drive machines to perform useful work; the discovery of electricity, and its ability to power lights and motors; the advances of electronics, enabling easy and rapid communications; advances in transportation that allow goods to be easily and quickly delivered all over the globe; the development of computers, enabling all sorts of calculations and data transformations to happen at dizzying speeds and scales; the development of intelligent robots that can perform complex and intricate and adaptive work. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Taking this closer view of advancing technology, we must ask ourselves, how many more tricks are waiting to be discovered? And how much more can human productivity be increased? And we must confront the very real possibility that the answers to these questions might not continue to support ever-increasing levels of human productivity. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>As technology and other artifacts of our culture continue to advance, human beings must adapt to changes in the value of different sorts of labor. With the advent of powerful machines, the value of sheer muscle power decreases. With the introduction of computers, the value of human calculation decreases. With the advent of intelligent robots, the value of the coordinated use of human senses and hands decreases. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Each new wave of technology tends to place another layer of indirection between the laborer and the goods and services he or she is producing. The worker is no longer hunting and collecting tonight&rsquo;s dinner directly, but crafting a tool to be used in the hunt. Then the worker is no longer crafting the tool directly, but a machine that can make the tool. And then the worker is writing a computer program to drive the machine to make the tool. And then the worker is writing a computer program that can learn from its environment, and can teach itself how to produce the machine to make the tool. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>With each new advance in technology, and each new layer of indirection, the most highly valued work becomes less and less intuitive, and requires more and more training and education and capital. The ability to do the most useful work can no longer be passed down from one generation to the next, and can no longer be learned on the job, and can no longer be performed with tools that individual laborers can easily acquire and own. And so the costs of educating and equipping labor grow, with diminishing returns on those investments for all except the smartest and best educated.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>As human population levels continue to grow, it becomes increasingly evident that we can think of the Earth as a collection of valuable resources &ndash; usable land, clean air, clean water, stores of energy, and so on &ndash; that is decidedly finite. In other words, we can think of the Earth as a pie of fixed size, and our ever increasing human population as a growing group of eager diners. As our numbers grow, each of us, on balance, gets a smaller slice of the pie. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>As our human population grows and covers the planet, we increasingly crowd out other life forms, causing the extinction of other species at an alarming rate &ndash; even species that we know form vital links in our own food chain. These actions have a cumulative effect over the years. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>As human population levels grow, we begin to deplete the Earth&rsquo;s non-renewable resources, such as subterranean ores and minerals and sources of energy. This action also has a cumulative effect. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>As human population levels grow, we generate increasing amounts of pollution, pollution that degrades the quality of human lives, as well as the viability of non-human lives. Again, this activity has a cumulative effect over the years.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Although advances in technology and trade increase human productivity, they also often produce negative side effects. Indeed, as we look around at our modern world, it becomes apparent that these negative impacts are becoming increasingly pervasive and harder to avoid: fracking produces cheaper and more plentiful energy, but pollutes our groundwater and undermines the structural integrity of the very ground we live on; industrial farming methods create cheaper and more plentiful food supplies but rely on unhealthy and unsustainable uses of antibiotics, pesticides and fertilizers; factories produce growing quantities of ever more desirable and affordable gadgets, but while throwing off ever higher and increasingly dangerous levels of pollution. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>As industrialization and urbanization spread to new corners of the globe, resource demands and environmental impacts tend to grown on a per capita basis. So not only are the numbers of people increasing, but the negative effects per person are increasing, acting as a multiplier for damaging effects of further population growth. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>We can see that we have a shifting dynamic system with two sets of opposing forces: on one side, we have the possibility of ongoing increases in human productivity enabled by continued advances in the evolution of human culture; on the other side, we have the multiple and growing negative effects of continued human population growth. Given the apparent imbalance of these forces, it seems unwise to continue betting on the speculative ability of new cultural changes to offset the growing negative effects of rising population levels. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Because of the size and complexity and dynamism of the totality of human systems operating on our planet today &ndash; comprising local, national and global governmental agencies, nonprofit organizations, privately and publicly owned for-profit entities, a multitude of media sources, political and religious organizations, and so on &ndash; our ability to assess the overall state of affairs for humanity is often murky, difficult to ascertain with clarity in the best of circumstances, and easily obscured or misinterpreted by those with particular ideological axes to grind, or with personal financial interests to pursue. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>The globalization of the world economy, in particular, makes it difficult to ascertain how well humanity is doing as a whole. As production shifts to cheaper labor pools, and jobs are lost in developed countries, but gained in developing nations, and wages increase in those areas, while still holding down the costs of goods, it is hard to tell whether humanity as a whole is winning or losing. In some ways, globalization feels like a shell game, almost as if it were designed to confuse those watching about the true state of affairs. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Ever increasing population levels, shrinking resources, growing environmental impacts, globalization of world markets and labor pools, a relentless drive for increased productivity, excess supplies of unskilled and semiskilled labor &ndash; all of these factors conspire together to reduce the perceived value of human life. As the standards for human wants and needs and expectations grow, we find that each human places additional demands on society. But if all of these additional people are not needed, either as workers or as consumers, then what value do they have? And while we can cling tightly to romantic or religious notions about the unassailable value of each and every human life, history shows that, in the long run, economics will overcome philosophy, if they are not aligned. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>We humans seem to be at a unique point in our evolution. Although our knowledge and beliefs and reasoning powers have advanced in many ways, we still seem to be obeying an evolutionary imperative to continually maximize the population of our species, even though, from a rational perspective, it is becoming increasingly clear that further increases in our population levels &ndash; and even continued sustainment of current levels &ndash; can be achieved only through a trade-off resulting in a diminished quality of life for the majority of humans on our planet. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>For those who understand our current situation, and who care for our fellow humans on this planet &ndash; those we might call the <a href="http://www.practopians.org/">Practical Utopians</a> &ndash; there seems to be only one available lever for us to use, only one reasonable point of emphasis for our efforts: help to reduce human reproduction rates so that the total size of our human population decreases over time. </p></li>
