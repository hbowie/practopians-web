						A Twenty-Six Legged Stool?
					</a></h3>
					<p><p>A few years ago, when I was teaching software development, I often invoked the image of a three-legged stool, with each leg representing one of the essential leadership roles: leave out any one of them, you see, and your project is liable to fall over. The human mind is pretty good at understanding these sorts of visual analogies, and is also pretty good at working with short lists of important things. This limited numeric range is, perhaps, unfortunate, because, as far as I can discern, there are no fewer than twenty-six essentials that modern humans must keep their eyes on in order for us to keep civilization as we know it moving forward on a reasonably even keel. Ignore or devalue any one of them, I maintain, and it is human society that starts to fall over.</p>

						Humanism

					<p><p>The first Practopian core principle states that &ldquo;We are humanistic: we are focused on human concerns and human potential.&rdquo; The primary intent behind this statement is to signal that we don&rsquo;t claim to represent any authority other than our own very human selves, and that we focus on the interests of ourselves and our fellow humans. However, there are a whole host of Humanist organizations already in existence around the globe, representing a Humanist movement of sorts, and so it may be helpful to comment on how I see the Society for Practical Utopians in relationship to these other brands of humanism.</p>

					<p><p>I&rsquo;ve recently read <em>The Common Good</em> by Robert B. Reich, and can recommend it heartily. It&rsquo;s a lovely little book that can help remind us all that we have obligations to the societies in which we live and work, and that contributing to the common good should be a daily calling for all of us. Still though, I can&rsquo;t help but feel that Reich&rsquo;s description of the unraveling of the common good in the USA is incomplete, and so I&rsquo;d like to offer something of an addendum with the words that follow.</p>

					<p><p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that Big Thinkers &ndash; people like Ken Wilber and Yuval Noah Harari &ndash; tend to get confused about art and why it matters. Unable to find a neat place for it in their developmental models of civilization, they end up citing that old chestnut of &ldquo;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder&rdquo; and leaving it at that, as an entirely subjective experience. Everyone&rsquo;s idea of beauty can be different, they say, and they&rsquo;re all equally valid. Of course, I&rsquo;ve never run across an actual artist who sees things this way.</p>

But that&rsquo;s perhaps as it should be, for Christmas, it seems to me, has always been too big a thing to be narrowly claimed by any particular religious organization.</p>

						The Nature of God

					<p><p>Human records indicate that some sort of belief in a God or collection of gods is a feature of almost all human culture. No matter what the continent or age, a belief in powerful, supernatural beings that somehow influence human existence is a near-constant. At the same time, though, many skeptics have persistently questioned the existence of such a being, and beliefs about the attributes of God have exhibited wide variation, with such variations often being so deeply held that wars have been fought to advance one sort of belief over another. Rather than approach the question of God&rsquo;s existence directly, it seems wiser to ask ourselves how we can best explain the facts above &ndash; the combination of a nearly universal human belief in God, combined with so far irreconcilable differences in what sort of God we believe in.</p>
