					<h3><a href="../blog/hbowie/a-twenty-six-legged-stool.html">A Twenty-Six Legged Stool?</a></h3>
					<p>By Herb Bowie </p>
					<p><p>A few years ago, when I was teaching software development, I often invoked the image of a three-legged stool, with each leg representing one of the essential leadership roles: leave out any one of them, you see, and your project is liable to fall over.</p>

					<h3><a href="../quotes/liberal-democracys-strongest-glue-is-economic-growth.html">Liberal democracy's strongest glue is economic growth</a></h3>
					<blockquote>
					<p><p>We are taught to think our democracies are held together by values. Our faith in history fuels that myth. But liberal democracy&rsquo;s strongest glue is economic growth. When groups fight over the fruits of growth, the rules of the political game are relatively easy to uphold.</p>

					<blockquote>
					<p><p>The golden decades of the post-war era bore out the theory of declining inequality. But over the last thirty years that has gone into reverse. During those decades, the share of the US economic pie divided between labour and capital was roughly 70:30.</p>

					<p><p>I believe that the rising intolerance and incivility and the eroding generosity and openness that have marked important aspects of American society in the recent past have been, in significant part, a consequence of the stagnation of American middle-class living standards.</p>
