					<blockquote>
					<p><p>This is why this book is my attempt to do the opposite of popularizing economics: if it succeeds, it should incite its readers to take the economy into their own hands and make them realize that to understand the economy they also have to understand why the self-appointed experts on the economy,&hellip;.</p>

					<h3><a href="../quotes/all-must-be-held-valuable-or-none.html">All must be held valuable, or none</a></h3>
					<blockquote>
					<p><p>But none of us has the right to assess the value of a human existence. All must be held valuable, or none. The death of Christ and the death of Socrates, Fen added dryly, &quot;suggest that our judgments are scarcely infallible&hellip;</p>

					<h3><a href="../basics/evolution-and-its-implications.html">Evolution and Its Implications</a></h3>
					<p>By Herb Bowie </p>
					<p><p>A belief in evolution is one of the core Practopian principles. But to say that we believe in evolution means quite a bit more to us than simply a denial of creationism. We also mean to imply that we believe in natural selection as a process for improving things, including human culture.</p>
