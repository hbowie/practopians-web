					<p><p>On the subject of climate change, I think we need to not only think of what sort of planet we will be leaving to our children and grandchildren, but start to think about leaving fewer children and grandchildren for our planet to have to sustain.</p>

					<p>By Herb Bowie </p>
					<p><p>I first came across Ken Wilber&rsquo;s work late in the last century when a friend handed me a copy of <cite>A Brief History of Everything</cite> as a birthday present. Wilber has described four quadrants of human knowledge, each representing a different and valid perspective on the same reality.</p>

					<p>By Herb Bowie </p>
					<p><p>When it comes to religion, I have to confess to being a bit of a mongrel. My mother was a Methodist. My father was a nudist. And I once called myself an immortalist. These days I choose not to align myself with any particular religious group.</p>

					<p>By Herb Bowie </p>
					<p><p>Human records indicate that some sort of belief in a God or collection of gods is a feature of almost all human culture. No matter what the continent or age, a belief in powerful, supernatural beings that somehow influence human existence is a near-constant.</p>

					<h3><a href="../blog/hbowie/reasons-for-belief.html">Reasons for Belief</a></h3>
					<p>By Herb Bowie </p>
					<p><p>We often seem to assume that people say things, and come to believe them, because they are true. It seems to me, though, that people take up beliefs for a whole host of reasons, and the likely truth or falsehood of these statements is often the least of the motivating factors at work.</p>

					<p><p>We tend to divide up human history into relatively neat periods, and give them names like &ldquo;The Agrarian Era,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Age of Industrialization&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Information Age.&rdquo; When I look at what&rsquo;s going on around me today and try to make sense of it, I am forced to draw the conclusion that we are deep&hellip;.</p>
