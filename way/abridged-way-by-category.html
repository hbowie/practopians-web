        	<h2>Mission</h2>

						<p>We Practopians seek to identify and promote beliefs, principles, values and actions that will result in a <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/mission.html">Brighter Future for Humanity</a></strong>.</p>

					<h2>A Human Perspective</h2>

						<p>We are <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/humanism.html">Humanistic</a></strong>: we are focused on human concerns and human potential.</p>

						<p>We place great value on the <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/written-word.html">Written Word</a></strong>, but place no faith in any single text that we deem to be sacred.</p>

						<p>We believe that we humans create meaning for ourselves through <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/stories.html">Storytelling</a></strong> and all forms of artistic expression.</p>

					<h2>Something Bigger</h2>

						<p>A feeling of caring <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/connection.html">Connection</a></strong> to others is part of what makes us human, and  makes us part of something larger than ourselves.</p>

						<p>We experience a sense of <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/wonder.html">Wonder</a></strong> in our approach to the world as we encounter the mysterious, the unexpected, the unfamiliar and the inexplicable.</p>

						<p>Although we cannot define the meaning of the word in any comprehensive way &ndash; or, perhaps, <em>because</em> we cannot fully define it &ndash; we believe in <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/love.html">Love</a></strong>.</p>

				</div>

				<!-- Column 2 -->
        <div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 col-xl-3">

        	<h2>Rational Thought</h2>

        		<p>We embrace <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/science.html">Science</a></strong> as one way of understanding the universe, and we accept toolmaking as one means of improving the human condition.</p>

        		<p>We believe in <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/evolution.html">Evolution</a></strong> as an ongoing force in the world, and in particular are interested in the continuing evolution of humanity.</p>

        		<p>We are particularly interested in <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/cultural-evolution.html">cultural evolution</a></strong>, since what it means to be human is so intertwined with our cultural identity.</p>

        		<p>We believe that we can produce better outcomes for humanity through the application of <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/critical-thinking.html">Critical Thinking</a></strong>.</p>

        		<p>In order to achieve positive outcomes from the complex social, economic, and ecological systems in which we live, we believe we must employ <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/systemic.html">Systems Thinking</a></strong>.</p>

        		<p>It is in the best interests of society to assist in the <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/education.html">Education</a></strong> of its members.</p>

				</div>

				<!-- Column 3 -->
        <div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 col-xl-3">

        	<h2>Our Social Contract</h2>

        		<p>We value the social fabric that binds us together as part of a shared human community, and believe in the need to establish institutions of governance for <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/society.html">Society</a></strong>.</p>

        		<p>As part of a <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/democracy.html">Democracy</a></strong>, all citizens should have equal say in defining society&rsquo;s laws, and equal opportunity to influence the operation of their governments.</p>

        		<p>Every society should establish a <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/rule-of-law.html">Rule of Law</a></strong> to govern human interaction, and to help channel human energy along constructive paths.</p>

        		<p>We believe in the private ownership of <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/property.html">Property</a></strong>, but also in the public ownership of property that can benefit society through shared usage.</p>

        		<p><strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/parenthood.html">Parents</a></strong> have an obligation to help their children become healthy, happy adults who make their own positive contributions to society.</p>

        		<p>It is in the best interests of society to encourage its citizens to engage in activities that will <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/value-creation.html"> Create Value</a></strong> for themselves and others.</p>

				</div>

				<!-- Column 4 -->
        <div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 col-xl-3">

        	<h2>Value of Individuals</h2>

        		<p>We believe that <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/individuals.html">ordinary Individuals</a></strong> have the power to shape our cultural evolution and influence our human condition.</p>

        		<p>We believe in allowing adults as much <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/liberty.html">Liberty</a></strong> as practical, so long as they do not infringe on the life and liberty of others.</p>

        		<p>All citizens must be treated with <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/equality.html">Equality</a></strong> before the law, without discrimination based on appearance, gender, ethnic origin, race, sexual preference, wealth or social status.</p>

        		<p>We believe in the <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/diversity.html">Diverse</a></strong> expression of human potential.</p>

        	<h2>Some Guard Rails</h2>

        		<p>We harbor no romantic notions about the <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/imperfection.html">Perfectibility</a></strong> of humans or of human society: we are satisfied with progress, and do not demand perfection.</p>

        		<p>We believe in striving for <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/balance.html">Balance</a></strong> between competing concerns, rather than establishing any single value as fundamentally absolute.</p>

        		<p>We strive to <strong><a href="https://www.practopians.org/tags/integral.html">integrate</a></strong> multiple diverse human perspectives in order to arrive at a more complete understanding of ourselves and the world around us.</p>
